To set up the git hook, you need to first set up ESLint. You can do so using npm:

```sh
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

If you use Babel to parse your Javascript, then you'll also need to install Babel ESLint, otherwise remove **babel-eslint** parser from your ESLint configuration.

You may install Babel ESLint using:

```sh
npm install babel-eslint --save-dev
```



Finally, to set up the pre-commit git hook, use:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath git/hooks/
```



The project also consists of a utility script that autofixes all JS files staged for commit (as much as possible). To use it, use -

```sh
sh ./autofix
```

Alternatively, you may choose to give it executable permissions using

```sh
chmod +x ./autofix
```

Post this, the autofix script can be used directly as 

```sh
./autofix
```



Remember, although this automatically fixes all your JS files, you'll need to stage them again before comitting so as to avoid unnecessary ESLint errors.
